## Notes

### Discovered APIs
Total of 20 APIs available from TfL portal:
- Existing (14): AccidentStats, AirQuality, BikePoint, Crowding, Journey, Line, Mode, Occupancy, Place, Road, Search, StopPoint, Vehicle, Lift Disruptions - v2
- New (6): API JPlive Public, Lift Disruptions (v1), NetworkStatus, Station Data, Status, Unified API

### Key Decisions
1. **UV over Poetry**: Faster, better environment management
2. **Keep OpenAPI 3.0 specs**: More detailed than unified Swagger 2.0
3. **Public API endpoints**: No auth required for spec fetching
4. **Incremental approach**: Phase-by-phase implementation

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking changes in generated models
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, version pinning, backwards compatibility tests
- **Risk**: TfL API changes without notice
  - **Mitigation**: Daily monitoring, automated spec fetching, change detection
- **Risk**: UV adoption issues
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, maintain Poetry files temporarily
