"""
Basic Functionality Tests for TfL API Integration.

Simple smoke tests to verify that:
1. Core clients can instantiate
2. They can make API calls to TfL without errors
3. Responses parse into our generated models

This is NOT testing TfL API functionality - just that our generated
models work with real TfL responses. No mocks or samples needed.
